## What Needs Configuration ‚ö†Ô∏è

### 1. Contact Information (CRITICAL)
**Location:** `index.html`

**Current (Placeholder):**
```html
Line 94: <a href="https://wa.me/5581999999999">
Line 77: WhatsApp: +55 81 9 9999-9999
Line 129: Email: us@filipeandrade.com
```

**Action Required:**
- Update WhatsApp number to real business number
- Update email to business email
- Test WhatsApp deep links work correctly

### 2. Social Media Links (CRITICAL)
**Location:** `index.html` lines 115-124

**Current (Placeholder):**
```html
<a href="https://instagram.com" target="_blank">
<a href="https://facebook.com" target="_blank">
```

**Action Required:**
- Add real Instagram profile URL
- Add real Facebook profile URL
- Or remove if not using social media

### 3. Branding
**Current:** "Real Estate Property"
**Should be:** "BR Services" (based on DEPLOY.md indicating brservices.ch)

**Locations to update:**
- Page titles
- Meta tags
- Logo alt text
- Footer text

### 4. Domain Configuration
**Current domain:** brservices.ch (configured in Firebase)
**Needs:** DNS configuration and SSL setup on hosting

## Known Issues & Limitations üîß

### 1. Admin Creation Problem (HIGH PRIORITY)
**File:** `admin.html` lines 637-652

**Issue:**
The "Add New Admin" feature uses `createUserWithEmailAndPassword()` which only works in development. In production, Firebase security rules prevent client-side user creation.

**Current Code:**
```javascript
await auth.createUserWithEmailAndPassword(email, password);
```

**Solutions:**
1. **Remove the feature** and create admins manually via Firebase Console
2. **Use Firebase Admin SDK** (requires backend/cloud function)
3. **Use Firebase Functions** to handle admin creation securely

**Recommended:** Option 1 for now (manual creation), upgrade to Option 3 later

### 2. Missing Translations
Some status values and types might need better translation handling:
- Property types (Residential, Commercial, Mixed)
- Documentation status (Registered, Pending)
- Position types (Corner, Front, Middle)

### 3. No Image Gallery
Properties currently only support video, no image galleries. This might be needed for properties without videos or for additional property photos.

### 4. No Property Search/Filter
The homepage displays all active properties but has no search or filter functionality.

### 5. No Property Detail Page
Clicking a property doesn't open a detailed view - all info is shown in cards.

## Security Considerations üîí

### Firebase Configuration
The Firebase config is **intentionally public** in the code - this is normal and secure for Firebase. The API key is NOT a secret and is designed to be included in client-side code. Security is handled by:
- Firebase Security Rules (server-side)
- Firebase Authentication
- Firestore security rules

### Current Firebase Settings
```
Project: real-estate-recife
API Key: AIzaSyCeg-p2HMp2YHwSXg_ulDxBkHmb6h-2ahU
Auth Domain: real-estate-recife.firebaseapp.com
Authorized Domain: brservices.ch
```

**Action Required:**
- Review Firestore security rules
- Review Storage security rules
- Ensure only authenticated admins can write

## Summary

**The platform is 80% complete.** The core functionality works well, but it needs:

- Nice-to-have features (images, search, detail pages)

The codebase is clean, well-structured, and ready for customization and deployment once the configuration items are addressed.
